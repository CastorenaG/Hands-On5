Classification with k-NN

This is a simple KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) classifier implemented in Python using the NumPy library and data visualization with Matplotlib. The code includes a KNNClassifier class that allows you to train the model with a training set and make predictions on new data. A plot_2d_and_3d_classification function is also provided to visualize classification in two-dimensional and three-dimensional data sets.
